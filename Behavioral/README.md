![alt text](https://github.com/manish24-tech/Java-Object-Oriented-Design-Pattern/blob/master/DP_img/chain-of-responsibility-mini.png "Chain of responsibility Behavioral Design Pattern")  
* Chain of responsibility let allow user-request to be process sequentially with group of objects of same type till destination
* Group of objects is nothing but handler object that decide whether to process(handle) the request or pass to the next chain of object sequentially 
* Ex. in organization, recruitment process for freshers and experience will be different. fresher has less level of interview then experienced and that will be decide based on number of experience like 0 or 2+
* At the end chain of responsibility should be prefer only when sequential process to be follow with series of handler check object to be measure the client request
